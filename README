This is the Github repository for the Mini-project in Databases with Aryeh Wiesen at the Jerusalem College of Technology, 2013. I am doing this project together with Yehuda Klirs.
The folder structure will soon be created. This repo will contain the instructions, the model, the code, documentation and other files as we need them.
