write at least two PLSQL programs
Cursor: just like iterator, goes through lots of records

Use Eliezer's book: PL/SQL for Dummies, PL/SQL dev manual
in pl-sql for dummies around  page 43 (italics mean placeholder):
	<<MAIN>>
	>declare
	>>v-[name]-[type] [type] ["DEFAULT" value] [:- assignment] ;
	>>cursor c_[name] is [SQL query];
	>begin
	>>DBMS_OUTPUT.out_line('string is' || [STRING]);
	>end
	
string: with single quotes 'Hello' / ''

open SQL command, DONT FORGET "set serveroutput on", then type the program
in the editor, then paste it to the command prompt, then enter slash, which
will make it compile, run and output.

etc etc, just read that Dummies book, chapters 3, 4 **6**

Level 3 reqs:
two programs, each with at least one local var and 2+ SQL queries, one cursor overall, with whiles/ifs (histaafuyot)
Start from Dummies example 6-5, and read substitution variables in Manual
